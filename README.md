        <h2 id="comparable-architectures">Comparable Architectures</h2>
        <p>We selected two GAN architectures, ProGAN (Progressive GAN) and DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), which are commonly used for image generation tasks and are relevant to our objective of generating celebrity faces. These architectures have similar complexities and are applicable to our dataset.</p>
