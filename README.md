## Comparable Architectures
We selected two GAN architectures, ProGAN (Progressive GAN) and DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), which are commonly used for image generation tasks and are relevant to our objective of generating celebrity faces. These architectures have similar complexities and are applicable to our dataset.

## Dataset Preparation
We utilized the CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset for training and evaluation across all architectures. The dataset was preprocessed consistently, including normalization, cropping, and augmentation, to maintain fairness in the comparison.

## Experimental Setup
Experimental conditions such as batch size, learning rate, optimizer, and training duration were standardized across all architectures. Consistency in these factors ensures fair comparisons between the architectures.

## Training Procedure
Each GAN architecture was trained using the same training procedure and hyperparameters. We monitored convergence, mode collapse, and other training dynamics throughout the training process to ensure fair evaluation.


## Conclusion
In conclusion, we summarized our findings and drew conclusions regarding which architecture performs best for the specific task of celebrity face generation. We also discussed potential implications, future directions, and areas for improvement in GAN architectures for image generation tasks.
