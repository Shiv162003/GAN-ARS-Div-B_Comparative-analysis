## Overview
The CelebFaces dataset is a collection of celebrity face images commonly used for research and development in machine learning, computer vision, and image processing tasks. It contains a diverse set of celebrity images captured from various sources, including movies, television, and public appearances.

## Dataset Contents
- **Images**: The dataset includes a large number of face images of celebrities in various poses, expressions, and lighting conditions. Each image is labeled with the name of the celebrity if available.
- **Metadata**: Alongside the images, metadata may be provided, including information such as the identity of the celebrity, gender, age, and other attributes.

## Dataset Format
The dataset is typically provided in a structured format, organized into directories or files. Each image is stored as a separate file, accompanied by corresponding metadata in a standardized format such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

## Usage
The CelebFaces dataset can be used for a wide range of applications, including:
- Face recognition
- Face verification
- Facial attribute analysis
- Generative modeling (e.g., GANs for celebrity face generation)
- Training and evaluating deep learning models
